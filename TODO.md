# TODO List for AdminPanel.jsx Improvements and New Components

## Completed
- Added debounced search for meetings in AdminPanel.jsx to improve performance.
- Implemented useEffect with 300ms delay to update filtered meetings based on search input.
- Updated meetings filtering logic to use debounced search term.
- Created complete BookMeeting.jsx component with:
  - Form fields: title, description, datetime pickers, room dropdown, attendees multi-select, meeting type radio buttons, file upload
  - API integration: fetch rooms/users on mount, submit meeting data, upload attachments
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Success/error notifications with toast
  - Redirect after successful booking
  - Tailwind CSS styling
  - Loading states and form reset
- Fixed BookMeeting.jsx error handling for API responses (normalized arrays, added defensive checks)
- Updated BookMeeting.jsx to match website theme (Bootstrap classes, consistent styling with AdminPanel)
- Added dashboard-like background (bg-light min-vh-100) to BookMeeting component

## Next Steps
- Test the debounced search functionality in the UI to ensure it works as expected.
- Test the BookMeeting component integration with Laravel backend.
- Review and refactor any other performance bottlenecks in AdminPanel.jsx if needed.
- Consider adding pagination or virtualized lists for large datasets.
- Verify all modals and forms work correctly with the updated state management.
